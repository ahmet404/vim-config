You can add the link anywhere in the document that best suits your requirements. For our illustration, we are generating a link at the top of the page so that if the user wants to jump to a specific heading, the link will take him/her there instead of navigating through the whole document.

So, we started the process by first adding the normal text as “Click,” and then we started the square brackets. Between these braces, the title for the link is specified. We have added the link label as “Section1”. Right after the square brackets without any space, we have inserted the round parentheses. Here we will add the reference of the heading to be opened when we click the link. First, add the hash (#) symbol and then write the specific heading’s title. Since the name of the heading, which is “Section 1” in our instance, has a space, while mentioning the heading in the link place, we cannot add spaces. So, to replace the space, we have inserted the dash (-) symbol between the two words as
